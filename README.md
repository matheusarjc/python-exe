<h1 align="center">How to do an Executable File on Python's script? :page_facing_up:</h1>

1. First of all, you have to install "**auto-py-to-exe**"

      `pip install auto-py-to-exe`
2. Open the terminal (or bash) in the folder where the Python script you want to convert is located and write this prompt:

      `auto-py-to-exe`
   
   After that, it will open a GUI window that you can set up the convert options, like, the type of output (onefile or directory), file's icon and others.
